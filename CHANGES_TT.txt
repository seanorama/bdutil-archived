0.34.4-tt - 2014-06-23

  1. Switched default gcs-connector version to 1.2.7 for patch fixing a bug
     where globs wrongly reported "not found" in some cases in Hadoop 2.2.0.


0.34.2-tt - 2014-06-05

  1. Fixed Spark's access to the GCS connector by setting SPARK_CLASSPATH and
     symlinking core-site.xml.
  2. Fixed a bug where the default spark-shell didn't run in distributed mode
     by now properly setting SPARK_MASTER_IP; used to require MASTER= to run.
  3. Wired through SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY to spark.executor.memory so that
     spark-shell can actually use all of the allocated Spark memory.
  4. Added a SPARK_DAEMON_MEMORY setting to better accommodate large clusters.
  5. Pointed Spark work/scratch dirs under /hadoop/spark to reside on the
     mounted PD if it exists rather than the boot partition.


0.34.1-tt - 2014-05-12

  1. First trusted-tester bdutil release; added extensions:
    -extensions/spark/spark_shark_env.sh:
        Basic Spark/Shark 0.9.1 (+Hive/Hadoop) installation, defaults to using
        a local DerbyDB for metadata store which dies with the cluster.
        Visit http://<master external ip>:8080 for Spark UI.
    -extensions/spark/shark_cloudsql_env.sh:
        Requires initial manual creation of a CloudSQL instance with an
        external IP address plus a root password. Configures Shark to
        use the CloudSQL instance as its metastore, setting up the hivemeta
        database if not already set up. Can be used from multiple clusters
        on-demand to keep persistent tables across deployments.
        You must fill into extensions/spark/shark_cloudsql_env.sh:
            CLOUDSQL_INSTANCE_NAME='<your cloudsql instance>'
            CLOUDSQL_IP_ADDRESS='<your cloudsql external ip'
            CLOUDSQL_ROOT_PASS='<your cloudsql root password>'
        Visit http://<master external ip>:8080 for Spark UI.
    -extensions/hbase/hbase_env.sh:
        Basic HBase installation which runs on top of HDFS; HBase is not yet
        supported to run on top of the GCS connetor due to some unsupported
        operations.
        Visit http://<master external ip>:60010 for HBase UI.
    -extensions/pig/pig_env.sh:
        Lightweight Pig-only install; try extensions/pig/validate-pig.sh
        to run a basic Pig script.
